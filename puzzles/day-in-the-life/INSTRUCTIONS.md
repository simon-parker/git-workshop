# Instructions

Welcome to a day in the life of a pair!

Your task is to get both `feature-1` and `feature-2` on master
while following the practices we talked about throughout this workshop!

Remember:
- `master` is the source of truth
- `feature` branches are for work in progress
- `git log` should be linear!

Here is what your history should look like after you're done!

```
* f612452 (HEAD -> master, origin/master) 7
* 944d439 6
* 6093682 5
* 56cb115 4

* 56e128c 2
* 6f41e02 1
* 5f6a102 initial commit
