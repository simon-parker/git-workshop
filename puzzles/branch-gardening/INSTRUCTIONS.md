# Instructions

Let's practice creating commits and branches!

Try to make your history look like this:

```
* 5ba0960 (i-have-2-commits) 5
* a5964eb 4
| * e33d3be (i-have-3-commits) 3
|/
* cd9436c 2
* d2657ba 1
* c0e58cb (HEAD -> i-am-just-like-master, master) initial commit
```

You can modify `foo` to have some changes to commit.
