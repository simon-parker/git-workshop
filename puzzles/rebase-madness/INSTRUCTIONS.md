# Instructions

Oh no! A chaos monkey has gotten into our git repo and scrambled our commits!

Your task is to restore peace and order to the world by making our history look like this:

```
* ff69d39 (HEAD -> branch-3, master, branch-2, branch-1) 7
* 1e2d5d2 6
* c738757 5
* f4c0ca3 4
* 3ba846b 3
* eede9cf 2
* 7af310a 1
* cb9e29c initial commit
```

And making foo look like this:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

Try to understand the history one commit at a time and call your shot!
